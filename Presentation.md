Getting to Architect: Strategies And Themes on the Path to Licensure
====================================================================

Becoming an architect is a complex series of individual choices, and some paths are (usually) better than others. Here are some large ideas to help ensure that advisees make smart choices on the way and some handy answers to some of the most common questions received by NCARB customer service

Strategies
----------

While there is no such thing as the right path for everyone, there are some ways that people can, on average, set themselves up for an easier (and quicker) time to licensure. If nothing else, it's important to consider the advantages and disadvantages that the following options may present.


*Accredited Degree
> Getting the right degree is essential for budding architects; in many states, the correct degree is a _requirement_ for licensure. While it may be a hard thing to hear, a candidate that wants to practice architecture in one of these states  will _have_ to get the right education. Starting out in the right program is ideal,  but the sooner a student knows the right way forward the better. Students with accredited degrees also do better on the ARE(citation), so it's a great place to start. 

*Starting IDP
> If you want to get licensed sooner, start the IDP sooner. Aspiring architects that started documenting their IDP in school got licensed about six months more quickly than their peers. While it won't make much sense for you to start an NCARB record if you don't have any relevant woerk experience, pursuing experience and documenting doesn't have to be put on hold until you graduate.

*Early Eligibility
> Just like how you don'y have to wait until you graduate in order to start your IDP, you don't have to finish your experience before you start testing. Students who started testing before finishing their experience were licensed between 1.5 and 3 years more quickly. It's not for everybody, and life gets in the way, but it's a great way to make solid progress to your license.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Thinking carefully about the questions above can potentially save years of time for people on the path to licensure. But there are also some smaller tips and tricks that can help with the day-to-day of working towards an architectural career. Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions for NCARB customer service. Knowing the answers to these can save aspiring architects some frustration.

* 'I am having trouble with the Citrix Practice Program'
> NCARB allows ARE test-takers to practice the exam in a cloud-based testing environment that some candidates have trouble using. If someone is having trouble using the Citrix Practice Program, have them contact NCARB Customer Service at customerservice@ncarb.org and there are a few technical tips that might resolve their specific issue.

* 'I need to resubmit my experience report to my supervisor'
> This one also is fixed with a quick email to NCARB Customer Service. It's an easy fix. A customer service representative can re-open the report so that the person can resubmit it. 

* 'I need help figuring out how many hours and years I can report'
> There are a few things to bear in mind for this. The first is that you can only report full experience for about eight months back. You can then report _half-credit_ experience for the past five years. 
> Additionally, for any given chunk of time, the My NCARB system will only allow a plausible amount of time to be reported. A report that accounts for the past month can't have 4500 hours of work in it. Some common sense math will solve most of these issues.

* 'How can I help my supervisor approve my experience hours?'
> When an aspiring architect submits a report for approval to their supervisor, the supervisor should get an email notification with a list of steps in order to approve the report. It should be pretty straightforward, but the basic process goes like this: 1. if the supervisor has never logged in to MyNCARB before, they'll have to create an account. Make sure it's created using the same email address that the report is submitted to.
2. once an account is created, they'll be able to see the submitted report in their XXX tab. From there, they can see the hours reported, and approve or return the report. 
3. if there are any other issues, NCARB customer service can help. 

* 'I need to update my license information'
> This is self-service! If you or a supervisor has a registration documented in their NCARB Record, it can be updated by entering the "Registration" section of their online account.

* 'How to best contact NCARB'
> Phone or email is the best way to contact NCARB. Customer service is available at 202/879-0520 or at customerservice@ncarb.org. NCARB is also on Facebook and twitter at @ncarb.
