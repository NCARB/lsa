Rosters,Jonathan Taylor,5,1/20/2011 3:40 PM,"A two part question:
1. How will rosters work going forward - will they be separate lists (published periodically), or will the SharePoint lists included on this site be ""the list""?
2. What is the process for adding coordinators to the list (and sharepoint access too).  When I give firm presentations, I first require they assign a staff member to be the firm's IDP coordinator.  Also, I try to get AIA NAC regional directors to become regional aux. coordinators.

NCARB Record Fees and membership period,Jennifer Gann,1,1/21/2011 10:57 AM,"Below is an email that I received from a student. Since eligibility dates have changed, then does that also change the period of time that the student has before the remaining fee for their NCARB record can be collected?
 
 
 
Hi Jennifer:
 
We recently had an NCARB representative talk to us at school, and he mentioned that our NCARB membership fee would only be $100 while we are in school and that the three year period of our membership would not begin until after we graduate.  I understood this as meaning my membership should expire in 2014 (three years after graduation), not in 2012.  Could you please verify this information and if it is correct or how I should go about changing my expiration date (he mentioned to call customer service)?
 
Thank you for your assistance!
 
Sincerely,

NCARB Mailbox,Margarita McGrath,2,5/29/2011 6:46 AM,"Hi,
On the bottom of the IDP Eligibility Form it invites the coordinator to email them to NCARB.  I'm the educational coordinator for ~700 students, and scanning & emailing the form after the signatures are complete has so far been doable.  I process them at the end of each week.  I just figured out that the mailbox has been rejecting the forms when I send them as a group.  Is there an FTP site or some other way to deal with the forms?  NCARB emailed back to mail them.  I opt for a paperless and ""fuel-less"" mode of delivery.
thanks, Margarita McGrath"
Confirmation on Part-time Rule,Margarita McGrath,5,5/12/2011 9:32 AM,"I've had several queries about the minimum amount of hours & weeks required to get IDP credit.  It seems many of our students are being successful this summer at piecing together internships that involve more than one office.  They have pointed out to me that taken together, their ""internship"" adds up over 32 hours over 8 weeks.  It still won't count though, correct?"

Competition credit,Michael Ayles,1,6/22/2011 3:01 PM,"All - I recently received a question regarding competitions that I was not able to find the answer for in all of the materials online and in my files.  I also didn't see any recent posts or discussions regarding the following questions.  ANy help would be appreciated!
An intern is interested in entering a competition (and has completed several in the past).  I know the rules allow for IDP credits for competitions - but it 1) must be approved, and 2) the intern must work with a mentor and have the hours certified by the mentor.
The questions are:
1) Does the mentor have to be an architect, or can it be an engineer (civil or structural)?
2) Who makes the decision about the training areas that apply for the hours credited?
3) Can the mentor also be a collaborator/partner in the competition?The specific competition this intern is looking to enter is rather ambitious and is more of a planning competition vs. an architectural one ... http://www.d3space.org/closethegap/Any additional clarification would be great.  Thanks!  Mike"

Foreign Internship,Margarita McGrath,1,7/11/2011 9:04 AM,"A student working in Lima this summer asks the following, 
""According to the conditions, this internship need to:
- Last at least 8 weeks
- I have to work for 32 hours a week (full time)
- The firm need to be engaged in the practice of architecture outside the US and Canada
- I need to be under the supervision of a person credentialed to practice architecture who is not registered in a US or a Canadian jurisdiction. So basically that is licensed in the country in which they practice.
I just wanted to ask you what exactly I need to get from my supervisor since I satisfy all the criteria?""
Two questions:
1.  She can work 15 hours a week, right? 
2.  Did the rules change about the supervisor registration?  They used to have to be US registered? (my own internship included 6 years of working abroad)"
Is there a twitter hashtag for the IDP Conference?,Joel Peterson,1,8/3/2011 9:28 AM,"Hi EVeryone,

Aux. Coordinators,Jonathan Taylor,2,8/3/2011 3:27 PM,"Hi Martin - two friendly suggestions:
 
1. on the Aux. roster, can we get a new column for ""type"" of auxiliary - i.e. firm, educator, state, or regional/area (i.e. Boston Backbay).  As the goal is to make this list ridiculously long, this keyword will be a great feature to better understand the type of Aux. support each coordinator has and where.
 
2. I love the new web form that AIA has for the free transcript number.  Do you suppose NCARB could mimic this as a form to sign up to be an Aux. Coordinator?  NCARV would still receive the info. by email, but no one would need to explain what info,. should be emailed every time, as the form would provide the space for everything needed.
 
Cheers,
JMT"
ARE Practice Software - Windows Work-around,Nick Serfass,0,8/5/2011 3:37 PM,"All,
 
At the conference this past week, several people asked about a software work-around to the 64-bit issue occurring with Windows and the ARE practice software.  I've pasted text below that I received directly from the ARE department.
 
If anyone continues to have specific issues or problems with this condition, please send me an e-mail directly and I'd be glad to follow-up with our ARE department for more informtation.
 
nserfass@ncarb.org
 
Thanks!
 
Nick
 
 
 
Windows Work-around
 
The Windows operating system problem with the ARE practice program stems from the version of operating system installed on the computer.  Both Windows Vista and Windows 7 released 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  The ARE Practice Program works with the 32-bit versions but does not work with the 64-bit versions.  The ARE Practice Program works with Windows XP because XP was released as a 32-bit version only.
 
As for some potential workarounds, the candidates will need to access 32-bit operating system.  This may be as simple as finding a PC or laptop that operates a 32-bit Windows version.  If there simply are no machines available with a 32-bit operating system installed, then candidates need to investigate virtual machine (VM) technology.  A VM is a computer running inside of another computer.  You can create a 32-bit VM to run on your 64-bit machine.  Then, install the ARE Practice Program inside of the VM.  Several VM software programs are available free for download.  However, if you are creating a VM from scratch, you will need to install a 32-bit operating system in the VM (which means you will need to have the installation disk for a 32-bit operating system). 
 
For those running Windows 7, the Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate versions (unfortunately, not the Home version) of the software allow for a free VM download that already has an XP operating system installed.  The download is called XP Mode.  You start XP Mode and you are running the 32-bit operating system inside of your 64-bit operating system.  The ARE Practice Program can then be installed inside of XP Mode.
 
If candidates are working in an office, I always suggest they reach out to their IT staff.  Several offices’ IT departments already support VMs behind the scenes.  They may have a VM already setup that the candidate can easily access."
Record Application - Masters Degree Only,Jennifer Myers,1,8/8/2011 10:31 AM,"I have a question from an intern who is earning a 3.5 year M. Arch, his undergrad degree is in an unrelated field.  He states that when filling out the application to start his record he is asked to provide information about his B. Arch, which he doesn't have.  Does he have something incorrectly selected, that he is being asked for this information?
 
Thank you,

Left-Handed Mouse - ARE Delivery,Nick Serfass,0,8/8/2011 4:06 PM,"All,
 
During the IDP Coordinators Conference, the subject of the availability of a left-handed mouse was discussed at length.  As a result of this discussion, I've had a follow-up conversation with the NCARB ARE directorate.  Please see the information below which I hope helps to shed some light on the established policy:
 
The use of a left-handed mouse requires the settings on Windows to be reconfigured.  After reconfiguration, Windows does not successfully engage with the test driver (test delivery software) and NCARB’s exam content software on a consistent basis.  In other words, sometimes it blends seamlessly, and sometimes it does not.  
 
In addition to the inconsistency of the software, it was also determined that this condition could be “self-accommodated”.  The ARE vignettes only require a left-click.  There is no right-click or scrolling functionality.  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a candidate could simply place the mouse on the left-side of the keyboard, and use their preferred finger over the left-click.  In comparison, this would be akin to right-handed folks simply placing their pointer finger over the right-click.  Since only one button is active, this adjustment is fairly reasonable.
 
In summary, since a seamless software integration cannot be guaranteed, and a “self-accommodation” is reasonable, the use of a left-handed mouse has been prohibited across the board for the ARE.
 
I hope this helps clarify the issue.

2010 ARE pass rates,Donald Koster,1,8/10/2011 3:01 PM,"Nick:

ARE Follow-up / IDP Coordinators Conference,Nick Serfass,0,8/12/2011 8:49 AM,"All,
 
      I made several notes during the IDP Coordinators Conference regarding ARE questions, comments, and concerns that were brought to my attention.  As a result, I've since discussed these items with our ARE directorate.  I have pasted the exact responses below for your review.  If anyone has any further questions, or believes I may have missed their comment, please let me know and I'll be glad to follow-up further.
 
 
1)      Is there any way to make pass rates available by state?  
 
ARE:  Currently, pass rate data is not available in this way.  NCARB has talked about expanding the exam data we receive and will have the ability to pull this type of data with our future vendor.  Let the coordinators know we currently cannot provide this data however we are working on new systems that will provide the member boards state pass rate data as well as even greater amounts of data related to their jurisdiction.
 
2)      The pass rates by school portion of the website only allows folks to sort by state.  It was requested that a full display of all schools be made available in some format.  
 
ARE:  This is something that could be done now.  NCARB’s IS department would have to build the option to select “All States” in the State filter.  I have no idea when IS could actually get around to doing this – but we could certainly ask.
 
3)      I received a concern regarding the “pass rates by school"" charts, as the IDP Coordinator understood that an individual who attended multiple schools could list whichever school they wanted, and that school would be then credited for the pass or fail.  Could you comment on this practice?
 
ARE:  The pass rates by school are based on which school the candidate self selects as part of the post-exam survey.  So the coordinator is correct in that whichever school the candidate chooses – that school is credited with the score result.  There is no hierarchy built into the data and the data is not verified by any backend system.  In all reality, when I tested I could have pick UT even though I attended NDSU.  UT would have been credited with my scores.
 
4)      Not sure if you can answer this one:  Within the ARE, does a clerestory window need a structural (bearing) wall?  In other words, could you reason that it is structurally hung from above?  Perhaps we can’t discuss that, but I promised I would relay the comment.  Thoughts?  
 
ARE:  I have already had a phone conversation with one of the coordinators on this issue.  They had recently tested in Structures and wanted to clarify their understanding. 
 
You should let all coordinators that new Exam Guides were released for each division.  They included expanded content area descriptions.  As for this specific question, a new sample passing solution in structural systems demonstrates full support of all upper floor walls (including the clerestory) from below. 
 
I hope this helps!

Setting E?,Lee Waldrep,4,9/3/2011 11:35 AM,"Below is a note from a graduate student -- Beyond asking his questions, how do Record holders know if a setting is valid or not?
""I work in a non traditional work setting where my employer is a professionally licensed architect in Germany, but is practicing in the United States.  We generally do not do architecture in the traditional sense, but instead are a certifying body for a green energy standard.  I believe this puts me into Work Setting E.  Is this correct?
I originally thought, I did not qualify for a work setting, but now I believe I do.  If this is the case, say I work enough to meet either the part time or full time requirements in terms of number of hours, but only 5-10 hours a week I am doing activities that are in training categories C and D.  The rest of the time, I am doing work I can not receive IDP credit for.  Am I able to record these 5-10 hours and do the total hours I work, or the total IDP hours count to the hourly work requirements?""

Clarification - Transcript Submission,Alexis McCune Secosky,1,9/6/2011 3:13 PM,"I recall from the Conference, that students (at least in a NAAB/CACB-accredited degree program) only need to submit a complete transcript once they graduate.  
I am receiving transcript release forms, and it does not indicate this on the form.  Is this for all students or only those after a certain Eligibility Date (say, October 2010)?
It is a bit confusing for students.  This is indicated on the How Do I Start? Section of the NCARB website, but explicitly not on the form itself.

"IDP Eligibility Date Form, NCARB Record # and Payment",Michael Hricak,2,9/23/2011 4:05 PM,"As always, I came away from the Chicago NCARB/IDP mtg. armed with updated information and new understanding of the IDP process.
Please confirm the follow ""understanding"" (since I'm getting the impression that I'm wrong..........)
Re: Active Students Establishing both an IDP Eligibility Date and securing an NCARB Record Number.
My understanding:
A student can go to the NCARB website, enter enough information to secure an NCARB Record Number, without making any payment.
This number would be used on the NCARB/IDP Eligibility Date Form #1, and the IDP Coordinator would process the form and the student would have an established IDP Eligibility Date.
HOWEVER, if the student wanted to record TIME on his/her IDP record, they would be required to pay the initial $100. 
Kindly verify or send me information regarding the actual requirements to secure an NCARB Record Number.
Thank you.

Architectural intern provides structured learning for highschool job shadowing,Sean Gallagher,2,10/10/2011 9:13 AM,"Question:
I have a student that last year worked with a firm in Maine. His work there included about 96 hours of time instructing high school students that were in the office for job shadowing and to receive instruction on what an architect does.  My student developed content and exercises for the high school students as a means of guiding and structuring the time.  He has asked where this time might be utilized for IDP credit.  Is there an applicable category for this?
Thanks!

They have been in the industry for 7 years working with or for architects the whole time. They had completed the required IDP hours, but never documented their time with NCARB. Over the past year and a half they had let their NCARB account lapse because they had their old office email and address listed with NCARB. What are the options to get this time recorded with NCARB so they can begin testing?

Unpaid Internship funded by a Scholarship,Alexis McCune Secosky,1,10/27/2011 11:13 PM,"I have a student who was awarded a $1000 scholarship to fund an ""...unpaid or low paying internship offer...""  
She utilized this grant while interning (unpaid) for a City Planning Department (underfunded...) working with a registered City Planner (AICP).  Though this internship, she completed an analysis of urban parks with a number of site visits, was part of a community participatory design-based project that included work on an open space plan with editing and revision of documents, and was an integral part of drafting new urban planning policy for the city.  
Does this qualify under any work setting?  Also, I don't know if it would even qualify for Supplemental Education (either Core or Elective).  
I know that we discussed some situations like these at our conference and have a feeling that it may impact future IDP policies, but in the meantime is there anything that fits this student's (very relevant) experience??  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks! - Alexis"
IDP Supervisor initial email,Susanne Tarovella,2,11/8/2011 11:06 AM,"What is the proper protocol when an intern submits experience for the first time and the supervisor does not receive the initial email from NCARB? This seems to happen quite frequently due to spam filters and/or supervisors with an overwhelming volume of emails.
If the supervisor logs on to e-EVR without the initial link, will the intern's experience verification request show up?
If not, is there a way for the intern to request that the link be re-sent?

Transcript Issue: E-evr,Margarita McGrath,7,8/6/2012 11:23 AM,"Hi NCARB, sorry to complain, but I'm still getting my weekly question about transcript submission.  As mentioned at the Coordinator conference this past summer, students REALLY don't understand that they don't need to submit a transcript until after graduation.  As the educator coordinators pointed out -- the IDP Eligibility form is a ""make-work"" system that entails 2-3 people  (the coordinator, someone who verifies enrollment date in the School records, and the Director -- unless the coordinator happens to have all three roles).  Yet the transcript issue remains, and I answer questions & emails about this issue more than any other.  NCARB:  Can you please clarify the transcript on the website interface or get rid of the IDP Eligibility form?  I'd much rather spend my volunteered time mentoring interns than counseling them on paperwork issues."
IDP Eligibility Date for an alumnus,Lynn Burke,1,11/8/2011 11:11 AM,"I have an NU alumnus that is looking to start the IDP process.  He graduated several years ago with a BS degree in Architecture, not the MArch accredited degree.  Can he still submit his transcript to start the IDP process now, or does he need to be enrolled in an accredited degree program to do that?  
He used to meet the following criteria: ""Enrollment in a pre-professional architecture degree program at a school that offers a NAAB/CACB-accredited degree program"".  However, now he is no longer enrolled in a program.  How does he now establish an IDP Eligibility date?"

All wokr done by students which gave them credit for studio during the previous semester can not be counted. 
But volunteer work above and beyond the ""class"" work, can 
count under training setting FF.

Supervisor registration / office location,Donald Koster,4,11/29/2011 9:01 AM,"I'm an education coordinator in St. Louis and I received a question today that I was hoping I could get feedback on and perhaps this example might be arising with more frequency in similar circumstances and might warrant further consideration. The question came from a firm principal, licensed in the State of Missouri, who for personal and economic reasons has recently relocated his office to his home across the river in Illinois where he is not licensed. 100% of the firm's work is in Missouri, where it was historically located and where his intern has performed his work. The firm principal and IDP supervisor has recently been unable to log his intern's hours and we think it is because his license no longer matches his office jurisdiction. Is there an exception that can be made, or petition process that this intern can engage to receive the hours that he performed prior to the office move that was beyond his control? NCARB has modernized the intern/supervisor relationship to reflect modern practice should/can the jurisdiction /office location be loosened, as well?

Illinois Rules,Frank Heitzman,1,12/5/2011 10:33 AM,"The following paragraph from the Illinois Rules seems to not be exactly what NCARB had in mind with its rolling clock. NCARB provides a 5 year ""shelf life"" for each separate division. That is, one could take more than 5 years to pass the entire ARE, but may only need to take one or two divisions over whose shelf life has expired. The Illinois rule reflects a drop-dead time limit of 5 years, period.
“An applicant shall have 5 years from the passage of the first examination to successfully complete all examinations required by rule of the Department.”

2. she has passed all Nine of the ARE sections.  again, she took these prior to the changes in the Canada's testing so they are the ARE.

EPC and Engineering Systems,Gary Dunn,2,12/21/2011 5:17 PM,"Got an email from an intern over the weekend who is being proactive and trying to finish off some training areas he's close to completion on before the IDP 2.0 change in April. He is currently unemployed and decided to use the EPC to finish off his Engineering Coordination training area and he found something interesting. All of the core exercises for that training area ask you to use a current project you are working on to use for the exercise... which is problematic for anyone unemployed and therefore not working on any projects. Is this intentional or an oversight? If unemployed interns are being told to utilize EPC to help get core hours, shouldn't there be at least 40 hours of exercises available to them in each area that doesnt require utilizing current projects as if they were employed?"

Work Visa International Students,Venesa Alicea,1,2/15/2012 9:39 AM,"I have been approached with the following question from an international student here in NYC. This is a common question here, so I figured I would post on the forum, to find out what the Norm is. 
Are Work Visa's supposed to be paid (Partial or in Full) by the employer or the Applicant? 
Student Situation Below: 
I am an international student and would like to stay and practice in the US after graduation. My question is regarding the work visa,  I know that I can practice in the US for a  year on my student visa but after that must get a work visa. I know  that part of the visa fees must be paid by the employer and the  remaining amount is paid by the applicant. But I have come across more and more stories from friends and acquaintances of offices telling  them that they will not cover it (I've been told that this is actually  against the law, so what they do is supply the money to the firm and  then they pay it)."

IDP Credit for work outside of the office,Hal Havens,2,2/22/2012 9:56 AM,"There are IDP categories that are very difficult to obtain hours in our office and probably many others.  An example is the requirement for cost estimating.  We have 60 people in IDP and we do very little cost estimating.  An intern asked if he could do an estimate for a project that he is working on schematics in the office on his own time and then review it with an architect to get credit.  Is it possible to get credit for hours spent on architectural task outside office hours that the firm isn't doing as a service to our clients?  I know that an intern can get hours using EPC activities, but that only counts for 40 core hours in a training category."

Eligibility Date for a May 2010 grad just now registering for IDP,Alexis McCune Secosky,4,3/6/2012 11:32 AM,"I have a former student who contacted me, and is now registering for IDP. (yay!) He graduated in May 2010. The enrolled eligibility date under the July 2011 guidelines would be January 2005, and since he is enrolling now, he is not counting any experience prior to October 1, 2010.  I am assuming that I would proceed as normal.
However, I am a little confused by the wording in the Guidelines on page 12, ""Under the IDP eligibility dates effective 1 October 2010, the earliest eligibility date you can obtain is 1 October 2010. For experience earned prior to 1 October 2010, you must comply with the eligibility dates in effect prior to 1 October 2010.""
Do I submit his Eligibility form accordingly (eligibility date of January 2005, his date of enrollment in our program) as I would with my current students, or because he was a student under the old IDP, would this be summer after his third year with the guidelines prion to 1 October 2010 (eligibility date of May 2007). 
Or would his eligibility date be 1 October 2010????? 
I hope this makes sense... I am a little confused.  Thanks!"

Lost Hours,Douglas Viehmann,4,4/18/2012 9:49 AM,"An intern wrote to me with this question/observation.  Anyone else hearing this?  I have not yet called him for more detail:
 
This weekend NCARB will begin IDP 2, which involves reallocation of required hours among the various activities of architectural practice.  Some activities will have hours added, others will have hours reduced; the total number of hours required to complete the IDP remains at 5,600.  In my case, I will have 300 hours added in two categories.  I will have no hours reduced, as I have already completed all categories in which hours are being reduced.
 NCARB has stated repeatedly that the total requirement of 5,600 hours to complete the IDP will not change with IDP 2, but that is not true.  I will now be required to complete 5,900 hours, with the addition of 300 hours in two categories in which there is little opportunity for accumulation of needed hours in the firm where I now work, and essentially no opportunity to get those hours with my role and position in the firm.  It will take me years to complete those 300 hours."

Anyone Involved with ARE Prep?,Nick Serfass,3,7/9/2012 12:52 PM,"Hello Coordinators,
 
We are looking for a couple coordinators to help lead roundtable discussions on ARE prep strategies at the IDP Coordinators Conference this year.  
 
Is there anyone out there who may have helped lead a prep series/session at a firm, AIA component, or school who may be willing to help with this effort?  Or, if you simply have a set of good strategies that you used yourself to complete the ARE, we'd love to have you on board as well.
 
Ultimately, the coordinators involved would simply lead a review of their strategies during several 10-minute roundtable discussions involving approximately 10 coordinators during each session.  This is NOT a full-fledged presentation in front of the entire conference . . . just a roundtable discussion.

How I tackle the IDP Eligibility form,Lynn Burke,6,8/4/2012 10:35 AM,"Hello All,
 
First off it was so great to see most of you in Chicago.  I feel so energized when I come home from the IDP CC.  So thank you to all that were involved--Nick, Martin, Harry and others.  Already looking forward to next year!  
 
A few of you asked me during or after the conference on how I tackle the IDP Eligibility form submissions with ease, so I thought I would post here.
 
I keep an electonic copy on my desktop for every class year, complete with my name, My Dean's name, enrollment date (my freshmen have enrollment dates of Sept 1, 2012), sophs are 2011 etc).  I count backwards.  Most of the info is pre-populated.  The only thing I do is plug in the students' NCARB record number, name of student, and dates.
 
Students e-mail me when they get a record number and want to start the process.  Neither my Dean nor my registrar touch these forms.  I also don't go back and forth with signatures, I simply use the check off boxes.  Sometimes a student will fill out the top half of this form and e-mail me.  I simply copy and paste their NCARB record number and name to my pre-populated form so I don't have to fill anything else out!  Much easier.
 
Some of you suggested you don't know when a student enrolled, and you don't have access to that info.  When a student comes to you to ask you to fill this form out just ask them for their NCARB record, name and when they started in the program.  Most students will tell you they are a first year, second year etc.  Then count back from however long your program is in order to come with the enrollment date.  
 
My program at NU is 5 years for the pre-professional degree, so if a student is a second year student, the enrollment date is Sept 1, 2011.  Or if you simply can't get that info from a student or a database, e-mail your registrar with a list of names all at once.  I would do that on a weekly, or bi-weekly basis.
 
I uploaded a (dummy) form so you can see what I do.  I filled this out for a sophomore recently. The fields (1-4) are the only pieces of information I fill out for a student.  This takes me two seconds of my time, and when I plug in the information, I e-mail off to NCARB and send the student a copy.
 
Nothing scientific, just easy. Also, don't forget to change dates on bottom.
 
Hope this helps."
"What does ""Enrolled"" mean . . . ?",Connie Caldwell,3,8/6/2012 10:32 AM,"This question (that I just rec'd from a student) came up in my round-table speed-dating session at the conference: ""I am an incoming first year architecture student. I am working in a paid internship this summer in an architecture firm. On the NCARB website, it says you have to be enrolled. If that is the case, can I begin counting my hours since I am *technically* enrolled in the B.Arch program? Or would I have to wait after the first year?""  Appropriate response?"
2012 IDP Coordinator's Confererence Notes,Otto Poticha,0,8/6/2012 12:57 PM,"Aug. 4, 2012
IDP Coordinators
Having just returned from the Chicago Conference, I had the time to reflect on that experience.
The conference was great and the IDP2.0 is an improvement.
I recall when the IDP program was designed and adopted; it's primary goal was to benefit the Interns. It was and I hope still continues to be a tool for the Intern. It is to make the intern's learning experience or training productive for the intern. It is a means to serve the intern as the second part of their education. It was meant to provide the intern a means to be unchained for three plus years to a computer in a dark space or only detailing toilet rooms. It was and is a tool with a prescribed curriculum and a means for the Intern to be aggressive with an employer and to get a 3+ years of balanced experience with the monitoring and documentation to certify those experiences. I believe this is the reason the IDP program was necessary and supported. I don't think the  goal of the IDP process has changed but has lost it's meaning with too many steps, rules and hurdles. I hope we remember that it is for the benefit of the Intern and not NCARB, NAAB, AIA, AIAs or the ARE. Nor was it meant as a networking tool or to assist forming social and peer groups of young architects. 
I believe there are different roles the University and the Profession. The role of the University is to educate and the profession is to train. To self-educate is very difficult and needs structured teaching support and assistance. To self-train, with some monitoring, is possible. The Universities are not and should not be factories to produce office fodder; rather their role is to provide for the student a wide exposure of the wonders of architecture and exploration, to help discover architecture as an art form and a creative experience. This should be the result of exposure to a fascinating, stimulating and broad educational base. Learning to think, inquire and integrate is the foundation of all education including architecture. Training and trade schools are different and far easier to culture and requires less intellect and passion. I believe the roles and responsibilities of educating and training are separate. They can and must connect but one should not devour and digest the other. Exposure to the profession, the vocabulary of the profession and an understanding of the process are important but not the main ingredient of educating passionate, well-educated and skilled architects. We do need ""mechanic architects"" but they do not produce Architecture, they only produce Buildings.
I believe that candidates who desire to be an architect must develop their skill, passion and initiative. To take on this important career choice, one must excel with both their education and training. The public’s trust requires one to excel in the training portion. The IDP and the ARE are the current means of certification or grading of the training experience portion separate fro the education portion. The interns must understand the benefits and rewards of the IDP program and possess the self-initiative to work their way through this certification program and must have the self-commitment to achieve and accomplish these requirements (At least those seeking their internship in my office). These interns, if committed, will be better architects if and when they  achieve these milestones without coaching and hand holding. If left alone, this might be another test as important as the other pillars of the IDP program to conclude whether these interns will or can be exemplary architects.
I am bothered that we, the coordinators, do not stress how this valuable tool is meant to benefit the intern. Rather the IDP and ARE process is portrayed or understood as being difficult and a burden, not a tool and not for the benefit of the intern. The process implies a lack of trust on the part of the intern, the mentor and the supervisor with its elaborate regimentation, deadlines and bookkeeping necessary for certification; and is easy to see why it is perceived as a burden or hazing and not as a benefit. Similar to the income tax process and methods, it must be a Washington DC curse.
I found a great deal of the discussion at the conference centered on means or methods that were shared to entice intern candidates to start their NCARB record early, form organized groups, become a part of the AIA or AIAs. I found Coordinators discussing methods and means to recruit these interns or students to get on the bus and get on with the program. We discussed making it mandatory that beginning students must start their NCARB record and AIA affiliation. We discussed bonding and having pizza parties and social events. I have found that anyone, students and adults will accept any coaching or help without developing their own initiative. We all know that too much assistance and help erodes initiative. If I offered to come to your house every weekend to mow your lawn, clean the garage or read you the Sunday paper, you would certainly accept and not appreciate the value and rewards of doing it your self. I was very bothered by these programs and the recruiting and babysitting of these candidates. 
I believe the role of the IDP coordinators is very simple and not very time consuming.
The Education Coordinators; need to understand the program; expose the students to it, the intent, the benefits and the process, especially the benefits. If the students want this career they will have to excel in both the university experience and training portions of their education and the necessary certification in both. It is their choice or not, when and how they engage the whole education program.
State Coordinators; need to understand the program, answer questions from the interns, assist (when necessary) with mentors and supervisors questions. Attempt to help with those unusual cases and situations.
Perhaps there a motive behind those ""help and assist programs,""  is to generate more funds for NCARB, recruit more Associate members of the AIAs or AIA? Perhaps another motive would be having more registered architects in an office to benefit the office in marketing and raised billing rates, not making better architects.  None of this was ever a part of the basic concept of the program, a tool for the intern.
 
IDP 2.0 is simpler and attempts to find ways to make every hour count towards the ultimate goal. I happen to think the counting of hours in school, some hours doing other things or including teaching hours is a flaw of the system. This subject consumed many hours at the conference and in the field and forum. These limited hours account for a very small percentage of the hours necessary to achieve the right to punish oneself with the ARE. Self initiated future architects would want these experiences to make them better persons rather than having to be rewarded for their efforts. That's double dipping and should be discouraged.
I came away feeling that since one has agreed to be the State or Education IDP Coordinator one must find a purpose or especially something to do or role to play. The role has becomes the recruiter or nanny for the intern and helps to display how difficult and what a bother the steps and procedures necessary to complete the IDP and ARE programs are but NOT WHAT OR HOW THESE PROGRAM BENEFIT THE INTERN AND WHY THE INTERN SHOULD EMBRACE THE IDP PROGRAM AND BE MOTIVATED BY IT. The ARE is another matter, it is just for the public’s benefit and not for the Intern.
This forum piece is more than one wanted to read but as an eight or more year State and Education IDP Coordinator, I have watched how the program has advance or declined. It is important for me to state my concerns. Many of these years, I have proposed that the IDP coordinators role be sunset. When IDP was initiated the coordinator’s role was very important. It was a new program, still being refined and needed those to explain and coordinate it. Now all Interns know of the IDP and ARE requirements, have had some exposure to it in their pro practice class and know where and how to find the necessary steps, forms and information. Today, the ideal role of the coordinator should be limited to answering questions not recruiting or holding hands. So with no important role why do we attempt to invent one?
This should serve as my conference survey response.

Can an intern earn IDP credit in THIS scenario?,Michael Ayles,2,8/9/2012 11:02 AM,"OK - gang.  Figured I would run this through the forum before going to Nick/Martin.  I tried to paraphrase/edit this intern's question, but still provide insight on why it might be unique ... despite how straightforward it may sound.SO ... an intern has been working freelance for a licensed architect since April 2011 doing CDs on five projects --- one of which has been ongoing for almost a year.  With the exception of that one project, and in light of the NCARB restriction of ""8 weeks consecutive"" and ""at least 15 hrs/wk"", those projects have not yielded IDP hours as they have either been short or inconsistent.  The longer project, though, has been a renovation/addition for a mid-century Modern house.  The intern has had extensive, comprehensive involvement with this project from the beginning and has done 100% of the 3D modeling and CDs, field measurements and photography, met with/coordinated the engineers and sales reps, and met with the client and contractor(s) - all with the licensed architect.  The intern even had input regarding design.However, because this project proceeded so slowly and stretched into such a long process of DD and revisions, there were quite a few weeks when the billable hours were less than 15.The intern understands the letter of the law with regard to NCARB rules, but believes this rule is extremely unfair, especially when this project might be considered an intern's dream -- full participation in every aspect of a project and full responsibility for documentation (with supervision).Is there any way the intern can receive credit -- for instance, if the licensed architect wrote a letter on the intern's behalf?  There are many hours worked on this project and the intern has learned alot regarding new roofs, almost total window replacement, removal of stair/addition of new stair, total gut of kitchen, new room on back, new foyer on front, conversion of a bedroom to a bath, re-landscaping of front with new terrace, etc. etc. etc.  There was even management of multiple phases and multiple design options in Revit, along with site topography.

How does a student log overtime hours under the academic internship category?,Lynn Burke,1,8/14/2012 10:37 AM,"This question just came in from one of my students who just finshed his 6 month co-op term at a firm in NYC, but then stayed on for an additional 6 weeks on his vacation period.  Not sure how to answer him.  I guess technically he could bypass the ""academic internship"" category but I don't want to tell him that if there is another solution?
 
""Hi Lynn. I wrapped things up at on Friday and now I'm trying to log my IDP hours but I'm running into a few issues.  In the ""Hours/Week"" field, I simply divided my total number of hours by the number of weeks I worked which came to 47 hrs/week.  However I'm not able to submit this for approval because 47 hours exceeds the maximum allowable for NCARB's Co-op setting, which is 40 hrs/week.  Those overtime hours total almost 400 hours so I'd like to log them if possible.
 Am I able to log all 31 weeks as an internship rather than an academic internship?  How have other co-op students handled this issue of logging overtime hours?"
"Student in US firm under the ""direct supervision"" of an unlicensed German trained employee",Sean Gallagher,2,9/4/2012 5:10 PM,"Friends,
I currently have a student employed by a firm in Minneapolis who is working under the direct supervision of an unlicensed German educated and trained staff member.

The firm has a licensed architect overseeing work within the firm but his participation in this students work has been somewhat limited.  I'm at a loss as to what experience setting, if any, to advise him to place these hour in since the employee that he is working under is not licensed in the US (Setting A) or Germany (Setting O).

I have two students returning from their summers working for firms and having started their NCARB records at the beginning of the summer.

Thoughts on how this needs to be resolved?  I have asked them to call customer service as well but I thought I'd put this out there as an issue that students are dealing with.  I now will be clear to make students aware that when they first start their records to be sure to wait for two months before logging their time.

Regarding: 8 weeks – 15hr min. req for “A”,Kris Palagi,3,10/2/2012 8:42 AM,"The student has been continually employed with the same firm since 2009, (licensed architect option A)
From 2009 – fall 2010 the student was working one day a week (4hrs.)
Fall 2010 – current the student has been three days a week at (13.5hrs)
She is just now signing up, but her eligibility will have started three years ago when she enrolled in the SoA.
Understanding that she is limited to only the last 6 months, is there a way of “honestly” getting around the 15hr week requirement?  I believe the intent of the requirement is to verify that the intern understands their role within and life of a project, it seems to me that this is met.
“When I started attending UH (Fall 2010), I continued to work once a week for a few hours, but they started to give me elevation and section drawings to work on (before was just plan drawings and notes) and not just editing, putting together construction document sheets for them, like existing drawings from measurements I record on site.  Also they allowed me to pick out finishes for interior renovation projects and I would arrange them on a board to be presented to the clients.”"

Foreign Advanced Degree Student: First Degree Equivalency in Home Country,Margarita McGrath,1,10/16/2012 4:08 PM,"Hello,
I have a question from a student:
1. My undergrad is a professional degree in Romania; a six year degree done at Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning within Technical University of Cluj Napoca - Romania (http://www.utcluj.ro/english/architecture_and_urban_planning/). I want to add my masters as an advanced degree in the supplemental hours, because I read that one can only do that if the undergrad is a professional degree, and since mine is I thought to try it. My question is, if I make the equivalence between my undergrad through EESA, would my master count for the supplemental hours?  
I did read that this counts if your undergrad is in USA or Canada, but I have a friend in Atlanta, GA and while she didn't do a masters, she did do the equivalence, had to take few general studies classes, did her IDP, took the exams and now she is an architect. I thought that as long as the equivalence worked for her, it might work for me to add my masters in the IDP supplemental hours as well. The reason I ask is two folded: first is that the equivalence costs about $1900, and I don't want to waste the money if the equivalence doesn't help me to use the masters; second is that it would shorten my internship with about 4-5 months.
Thanks in advance for help on this.  Margarita"
NCARB Record Transmittal for testing,Andrew Malanowski,1,10/16/2012 3:52 PM,"I have an intern in my firm who requested to have their record sent to our state on August 8th so they could begin testing but the state still has no record of receiving it.
 
They requested the transmittal and paid the remainder of their fee, have the confirmations of each and the charge to their CC.  They contacted Customer Support a week ago to ask the status but haven't heard anything back yet.  The inquiry number was 121003-000074.
 
I was hoping someone may be able to help me help them understand why there is a delay.  2 months seems a little extreme, I think mine was only a couple weeks.
 
One issue is the name on their record is their Maiden name, and the name on the application with the state is their married name (which will also be on their license).  Does NCARB have some way of dealing with this situation where a legal name may change after the establishment of a record?"
WAY past 6 months,Kris Palagi,1,10/29/2012 11:53 PM,"I gave a short seminar on IDP 2.0 today and this immediately hit my inbox. 
In past forums, Nick gave advice to begin the ARE and fast track the IDP to get through. One problem is, Hawaii does not allow concurrent IDP / ARE.  
What are the options for someone like this:
""I'm a 41-year old project manager/coordinator for a small architectural firm here in Honolulu.  I've been here for just over six years now.  Prior to that, I was working for another architectural firm in Pasadena, CA for 11 years as a project coordinator and draftsman.  While living/working in Pasadena, I did take and pass the CD portion of the ARE but that was probably about eight years ago and it was before IDP was required.  Well, time has passed and I haven't maintained anything and now IDP is a requirement for me getting back to taking the ARE.  At the NCARB website, I noticed that there are three different forms to establish my eligibility date for tracking my work experience.  Since I'm so far removed from my college days, I assume I'm supposed to use Eligibility Date #3 Form.  If my assumption is correct, and given my years of work experience, would my current employer for the past six years suffice as my IPD supervisor?  Or should I send it to my previous employer on the mainland?  Or can you suggest a better way for me to do this?  I appreciate any advice you can give me because I'm so out of the loop on the whole licensure process.  I kind of tuned it all out once I found out IDP took over but I'm at the stage in my life where I should be getting my license.  I just don't know how to start."""

When giving the “Career Building Blocks” presentation at Penn State, I was approached by a student with a unique situation. The student is the president of Students for Environmentally Enlightened Design (SEED), which is a multidisciplinary student organization to promote environmentally sustainable design. As a club, their main focus has been the design and construction of a shipping container based library to be sent to an African refugee camp. After designing and grant writing for 2+ years, they purchased a 40' shipping container and are now beginning construction at University Park, PA. The work is all volunteer (no academic credit) and is supervised by 2 faculty members, whom I believe are registered architects in Germany and PA respectively.  The student is curious to know if members can get IDP credit for the work that they have already done and are continuing to do.  The work is somewhat similar to that of Freedom by Design. More information is available at their website: https://stuckeman.psu.edu/arch/students-environmentally-enlightened-design-seed  I can’t imagine that this *wouldn’t* be eligible for IDP credit, but the question is “in what category?”  “Leadership and Service” seems like the knee-jerk reaction, but I can’t seem to think of a better option.  The students aren’t employed by the university, meaning that this couldn’t be considered “Teaching and Research,” and the program isn’t current recognized as a “Community Based Design Center/ Collaborative.” Has anyone dealt with an organization such as this one?  Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.Sean"
employment requirement - minimum duration,Stephanie Silkwood,1,11/8/2012 11:31 AM,"If an intern exceeds the minimum (15 hrs per week for 8 weeks) but then continues to work for the same employer for less than 15 hours per week, can they continue to report their hours?

Registration - Puerto Rico and US,Michelle Cohn,2,11/19/2012 12:11 PM,"Hoping someone can shed some light on this...I've received an inquiry from someone who's partway through the architect registration process in Puerto Rico but is wondering about getting his license in the US.  A few questions:
1. His undergrad was in PR, but his graduate degree was in the US.  Is his education requirement covered, or does he need to go through EESA?
2. He's taken the ARE in PR and finished all divisions, so no issues there.  It's the same exam, right?
3. He hasn't completed IDP since that's not required in PR.  Is there any issue with doing IDP after he's finished the ARE? And if he finds a US-licensed architect to work for in PR, can he finish IDP there, or does he need to move to the US to finish?
Thanks,

"Work Setting ""O"" + Supplemental",Jason Arnold,1,1/24/2013 3:00 PM,"I'm looking for clarification to what I suspect is correct:
 
An intern currently works for an engineering firm with direct supervision from a licensed engineer.  The firm does design structures in the built environment and as such provides planning and oversite of such projects.  This intern has almost maxed out the 1,860 hours in work setting ""O"".
 
In an effort to maximize hours that can be counted at this current position the intern would like to also place 930 hours under supplemental experience as ""design or construction related employment"".
 
Is there any reason why this would not be true?

Leadership and Service Experience Submission,Ariane Tattershall,2,1/24/2013 3:47 PM,"We have a few interns in our office who earned Leadership and Services experience hours by participating in activity where they were acting as mediators at a City Planning Charrette (Design Industry related). In reviewing the approval process for such Leadership and Service Experience, the IDP Guideline states that whenever possible, the individual certifying the interns leadership and service experience should be the person in charge of the activity at the organization. However, the intern’s supervisor or mentor can also certify the leadership experience. 
 
However, when trying to submit the experience hours in NCARB, the intern is not able to choose this “person in charge of the activity at the organization” to get the hours approved. As we understand it, the step by step process of what the intern is to do to submit the information is as follows: Step 1: Select new experience report; 2. Select Supplemental Experience; 3. Select Leadership and Service; 4. Enter employer and supervisor information, start and end dates, and description of experience; 5. Enter experience area and hours; 6. Submit hours. 
 
These are the only actions that can be performed when submitting “Leadership and Service” experience in NCARB.  There are no options to choose the person in charge of the activity at the organization (i.e. AIA) to approve any hours in lieu of the individual’s employer/supervisor.
 
Is there another option for us to process this for this person in charge of the activity at the organization to approve? Or are we doing this process incorrectly?
Any assistance with our inquiry is very much appreciated. Ariane"

Can presentations be counted towards Training units,Jean-Paul Grivas,1,1/24/2013 3:32 PM,"All,
 
I received this from an intern:
 
""Regarding supplemental hours, the categories I still need hours in to satisfy my IDP 2.0 requirements are:
-          Material Selection and Specification
-          Bidding and Contract Negotiation
When we attend Vendor Lunch and Learns in our office, a great deal of the content covers materials and information directly related to the way specifications should written (ex:  optimum slab moisture content for product install, or DIN standards for sports floors, etc).  Some of those in our office who attend these presentations actually make notes directly on their draft specs.  based on information presented by the vendors.
Can attending one of these presentations count towards training in either of those categories since there may not be active projects in the bidding and negotiation phase I can help with, and  the PM I am assigned to may not have draft specs. for me to work on?""
Please review and advise"
Intern with non-traditional experience,Philip Freelon,1,1/24/2013 3:39 PM,"A former student of mine has asked the following questions. Any guidance answering these would be much appreciated.
""I spent the last year on Maui, living and working on a bamboo farm building auxiliary structures.""
""Since my work experience was a bit different from a regular office employment, I wanted to ask you for some advice on what category to log it in.""
""I worked with a mentor/builder (an engineer but not licensed) and also an architect/engineer licensed in HI. I spent a year designing, pre-fabricating, and constructing small structures. The work involved many aspects of the profession on a smaller scale - client relationship, project management, site analysis, cost estimations, drawings, construction etc.""
""Is this work more appropriate for Experience Setting A: Practice of Arch or O: Other Work Settings or S: Supplemental Experience? There is also the Design and COnstruction Employment category which seems appropriate. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.""
""Also, I have two internships that I completed in 2008 - 2009 (right before starting my Masters), do they qualify for hours? I did study Architecture as an undergrad, so my eligibility date should be before then,...I am just not sure if it has been too long. The website states that it has been more than 8 months, is that the cut off time?"""

AIAS/ FBD Activities and IDP,Rashida Ng,5,2/8/2016 3:05 PM,"The officers within our chapter of AIAS and FBD approached me to find out what AIAS activities count for IDP credit.  The students are planning to participate in CANstruction and Relay for Life, both volunteer fundraiser activities which (as stated in a previous post), would seem to qualify for IDP within the Leadership & Service category.  However, our chapter often has ongoing fundraising (bake sales, etc.) that do not clearly fit into any category, including  Leadership & Service.  Is it correct that participation in a student organization does not by its own merit qualify for IDP credit, even for Leadership & Service?  However, certain activities of the organization with a clear ""public service"" objective would earn IDP credit within the Leadership & Service category.

Experience Setting - MEP Firm wants to expand practice,Gary Dunn,1,2/8/2013 11:48 AM,"Had this question come in and I don’t quite know how to answer part of it. Here are the details:
-Architect works for an MEP firm. 
-Firm is looking to expand to start offering architectural services, I guess making it a true A/E firm. 
-This would then qualify them into setting A as long as they are doing comprehensive architecture practice in addition to the engineering they already do?
-If yes then future interns they would be able to claim this as a Setting A employment setting?
-He has an architectural intern working for him that has or is about to max out his 1860 IDP hours allowed in setting O. 
Once they are operating as an architectural practice too, will this intern be able to claim those future hours in setting A since that same firm will already be attached to his Record as an O firm? Will the system recognize an error there and give him issues with reporting?Gary, TX"

Teaching/Research Assistantships in NAAB accredited programs,Donald Koster,1,2/25/2013 9:23 AM,"Dear Nick and Martin:
Following the last campus visit by Martin, I was under the impression that students in graduate programs working as teaching assistants within the NAAB accredited program were eligible to receive IDP credit under Supplemental Experience, however, it seems that students are unable to log hours because NCARB is requesting form 122 and prior educational experience.  The student who has brought this to my attention is nearing graduation, but does not have a professional degree, nor to my knowledge a pre-profeesional degree in architecture.  She does have a BA and substantial prior experience in art and architectural history that qualifies her for her TA position.  I wasn't able to find any mention within the IDP Guidelines stating that a (pre) or professional degree was needed to qualify for these hours.  Please advise, as customer service has been unresponsive to the students question.

Student participation in design reviews,Michael McGlynn,1,3/28/2013 2:22 PM,"We often have students who participate in design reviews and lately they've been coming to me to ask how they can receive IDP credit for doing so.
Must they request supervisor approval for this activity or is there some way to self-report that will suffice? As an Educator Coordinator, I'm in a much different position than a supervisor in an architecture firm. I may only document a couple of hours for an individual student, but may get dozens of individual requests to do so in a given year and would have to register as a supervisor each and every time to approve. This seems unnecessarily burdensome for what amounts to but a handful of hours for a supplementary educational experience.

Foreign Architect trying to enroll in IDP,Nathan Stolarz,1,3/28/2013 3:07 PM,"Good Evening,
I have a potential IDP candidate in Massachusetts that has a unique situation that I am trying to help her through. She is aiming to become a registered architect here in the US.  She has received a BArch (5 year accredited program) in the US, and received a MArch (post professional) from McGill University, Canada. After graduation she worked 2 years in an architectural office in Massachusetts (between 2008-10).  She understands she has missed out on those IDP hours.  Between 2010-2013 she ended up working in Bulgaria, where she became a registered architect. Bulgaria is a EU member country, so her registration is valid in all of the EU countries. Now she has moved back into the United States and currently doesn't have employment within a typical office environment but only has been able to get contract work.  How can she go about getting enrolled in IDP without having a supervisor to review hours?  I am working with here to try to find employment in a firm locally but it’s been difficult.  Is there any sort of reciprocity with EU countries at all the NCARB will work with?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"Is travel time, to and from site, eligible for IDP credit?",Ariane Tattershall,2,3/28/2013 3:38 PM,"Our office has projects throughout the US and some require us to do state mandated site observations. When travel is involved to do a site observation, there are travel times involved (obviously). With that, there is time spent at airports and incurring travel delays, car rental coordination, driving time etc etc. 
We have been asked by one of our interns whether any of that travel time (other than doing the actual site observation) could be eligible for IDP hours. Perhaps towards categories such as General Project Management or possibly Business Operations?

Question from past student,W. Geoff Gjertson,4,4/18/2013 1:04 PM,"This from one of my past students. Any input would be appreciated:
 
""Yesterday I completed my IDP!  When I log in NCARB tells me, “Your Record currently reflects that you have provisionally satisfied the requirements for the IDP. Your Record is currently in queue for a final evaluation. When your evaluation is complete, you will be contacted by a Record evaluator.”  So my question is, once my evaluation is complete will I need to request that NCARB  transmit my Record to the State Board or will it happen automatically?  I passed all of the ARE sections as of last fall so I have met all the requirements for licensure now.  As you can imagine I am anxious to finish up the process though I know I’ll have to be patient.  I just want to make sure that I don’t do or not do something that will slow things down even further."""

ARE without completion of education requirement,Susanne Tarovella,4,4/19/2013 10:30 AM,"Hello All,
I have gotten into a debate with a colleague regarding the possibility of students taking portions of the ARE before graduation if they have an IDP record.
This person adamantly argues that NCARB's position is to allow students to take sections of the ARE before graduation if the individual States' registration boards will allow it. I know Tennessee does have a provision for those with pre-professional degrees and architecturally related professionals taking the ARE if they have qualified experience, but there is still both a degree and experience component required.
I re-reviewed the NCARB website and our State of Tennessee website, and do not see any indication of student eligibility for the ARE.
Is this just old-fashioned wrong, or is there a basis for this rumor? I'm confused as to where someone would get an idea like this. I feel like it's pretty clear that a degree is required in nearly every jurisdiction. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
On a happier note, I can't wait for Miami!
Thanks,
Susanne in TN."

Undergraduate research,Alice Guess,1,6/6/2013 2:08 PM,"I have an architecture student who is working this summer for a civil engineer doing material research on concrete.  It seems like her work would qualify for ""O"" credit as she will be supervised by a licensed engineer, and she will be assisting research applicable to architecture.

Older Records Missing,Russell Wisniewski,1,6/6/2013 2:11 PM,"So I have a peer who registered to start IDP in 2005 in Arizona. He intended to originally go through the licensure process  by gaining AZs requisite experience without the M.Arch. In 2010 he had a change of heart and started the 4+2 M.Arch path at ASU. Just recently he went to reactivate his IDP account for the summer, and couldn't find his record. The last time he logged any hours was late 2007. Does he need to start a new record? If so, is he then losing all the experience he gained previously? Any help will be much appreciated.

what is all affected by the black out,Russell LaFrombois,7,9/29/2013 2:28 PM,"interns have been asking what will all be affected by the black out (signing up for IDP, logging hours, etc.)"
Is this Work Setting O or S?,Jason Newman,7,10/20/2015 2:35 PM,"Hi All-
 
An intern in my area reached out to me with the following situation:
 
The intern is working for a small design/build company which does not employ a registered architect (earning Supplemental Experience).  However, recently the company has contracted a registered architect to lead the design team on some of their bigger projects.  The intern will be working under the direction of the registered architect; and, the architect will be physically supervising the work.
 
Can the intern list the architect as a Supervisor and earn core experience hours in work setting O, even though the architect is not technically an employee of the design/build company?  Does the contractual relationship disqualify the architect from being an eligible supervisor?
 
Thanks for the help.

Hawai'i Concurrent Testing (YES!) and Question,John Vann,4,6/6/2013 2:28 PM,"I received an update from our local AIA office today that the Governor signed the updated Administrative Rules which will allow concurrent IDP and ARE testing (more at AIA Honolulu.  Great news!
Which leads me to the follow-up question: some of our interns have started IDP and ARE in other states (mostly for concurrency).  Is it possible for candidates to change states mid-stream?  How does the transfer work for IDP?  For the ARE? (especially for sections which have been passed)?"

Coordinators conference and AIA national Convention,Chris Lewis,6,6/27/2013 1:48 PM,"I'm new to being a stat coordinator, but with the national AIA convention going on this week in Denver I was wondering why the coordinators conference isn't more associated with the AIA convention. With AIA footing the bill for travel and hotel to the IDP conference it would make sense to me to be able to get some more bang for their buck by combining the two conferences together. I know I would enjoy the opportunity to be at both, and be available to a broader audience in one location. Just a thought I was having and perhaps a topic for discussion in late July."

2-      Applied for NCARB IDP electronic application only in March 2012. As of today, I have 3,660.75 approved hours reported.
3-      Back in 2011, the instructions from the Dept. of Commerce and Consumer Affairs for foreign degree evaluation is through ECE (attached old copy). I completed a general report and submitted to DCCA  office in August 2011 which indicated my foreign degree in Architecture has US equivalence. This application cost me $250. And then early 2012, DCCA announced that all foreign degree will be evaluated by EES-NAAB starting on May 2012 –which will cost $1,900. At that time, I only have 4.7 years of experience and would not be able to qualify to submit an application prior to effective date of the amendment.
4-      I also would like to request for your assistance  if there’s also an option for evaluation with foreign license. I passed my architect’s licensure exam few years ago in the Philippines before migrating to US. It’s already inactive as I am now a local Hawaii  resident and now a US citizen."

While I was in undergrad, I logged about 1200+ hours into my Canadian Experience Record Book (CERB): 940 hours in categories and the rest in discretionary hours due to the IAP rules for students. I have attached my approved CERB pages with a breakdown.
I have worked 1000 hours abroad in HK from January - July 2013 which cannot be counted for the new updated Canadian IAP program. However, I would like to include that if I enroll into the IDP. Ideally, I am hoping to count the combination of 2000+ hour. However, at the time we were not made aware by our school that we could enrol into the IDP program as well as the IAP. Because there such a significant amount of hours, I was wondering if it is at all possible to transfer the amount? Or whether it is eligible for the IDP at all?
Otherwise the worst case scenario is that I would include the last eight month of experience.
Are there any options or work-arounds available to this candidate?

Minimum work period,Sean Gallagher,6,1/9/2014 2:49 PM,"Nick and or Martin,
Wondering if you have any updates on the revision/modification of the minimum work period requirement for Interns (15 hours per week for 8 weeks)? It was noted in the IDP Coordinators Conference that the minimum requirement was being considered for elimination.  I have several students working on and off for architects while on preceptorship and their work has been a bit sporadic.  I'm finding that several of them are being employed as ""consultants"" for as-needed tasks for smaller firms.  They are all under the direct supervision of licensed architects but the continuity of 8 weeks has been a challenge.  So on their behalf I am reaching out to see if there's been any determination of the timing of when the 15 hours/8 week requirement will be eliminated - or if that is no longer the case.
Thanks!!

Hi Peter,
As promised, here is the summary of my previous work experience with Atkins:
I joined Atkins in October of 2011 as an intern and was promoted to an Office Manager/Project Coordinator (Assistant Project Management) position after 6 months. My direct line manager was a British Engineer with a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering. He acted as Project Director for most of the projects which I worked on, but I also worked under the Project Managers who ranged from being Architects to Industrial Engineers. The office was located in Saudi Arabia and the company (as well as most of its employees) is British, so the question at hand is how to count the international hours under international directorship. Please let me know if you have any questions and what NCARB replies about the situation. As a note, I left the company on April 28th so I should have until October 28th to sort out how to count these hours. 
Thanks for all your help.
Best,
Ana

K-12 Architecture teaching outreach for IDP experience,Alexis McCune Secosky,1,4/4/2014 4:31 PM,"Hello,
Through the School of Architecture at CMU, we have an Architecture Explorations K-12 Outreach program that employs our students to teach architecture to grade-school and high school kids.  We are trying to determine where (and if) this type of experience qualifies for IDP.  
I don't know if it would qualify for ""Teaching and Research"" as theses young professionals are not teaching students within a NAAB accredited degree program; they are teaching students in grades K-12.
I thought that it might qualify for Leadership and Service, but these students are employed so it isn't pro bono.  However, I was confused by the ""yes"" indication of the ""Whether or not Employed"" column of page 13 of the IDP Guidelines.  These students prep/teach 7-10 hours/week for an 8-week session (would the new Employment Requirement affect this too?). They are applying their knowledge while acquiring valuable leadership skills through their experience.
I am just not sure if this experience qualifies for IDP, and if it does what it would qualify under."

Maybe Nick or Martin will know the answer to this one:
I have seen the IDP record now request the intern's name of high school and dates of enrollment. Will NCARB now also be requiring a high school transcript due to this new change to IDP eligibility?
For example, an intern has received their M.Arch and is ready to sit for the exam, will they need to provide a high school transcript as part of the education verification process?
Just looking to get some clarity as I didn't see it in the guidelines or FAQ's.
Warm Regards,

IDP just got more flexible .. perceived ambiguity in wording,Chris Lewis,2,12/18/2013 10:22 AM,"I've gotten some requests for clarification on the verbage of the announcement yesterday as it relates to the removal of the duration requirement and recording hours. Here's the statement
""I'm still unclear as to whether that means it applies to hours worked from here on out, or if it means we can apply that to any hours we report from here on out, meaning we can count the past six months. That's one of my issues - things often seem a little hazy, and trying to find answers is always difficult both on the website and in the handbook""
The announcement stated ""In October, the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) announced two exciting changes to the Intern Development Program (IDP) that will go into effect 16 December 2013:
The removal of the duration requirement will allow interns to earn IDP experience regardless of a project’s duration.
The simplified eligibility requirement will allow interns to begin earning credit upon graduation from high school.""
i interpret the announcement that effective 16 December and going forward you can report experience of any duration but prior to that you cannot. Is that correct, or does the 6 month rule come into effect here to allow back to late April, Early May?

ARE 4.0 to 5.0,Sean Gallagher,3,1/16/2014 1:27 PM,"Folks,
I have several recent graduates who are about to begin sitting for the ARE getting all whipped up about the transition from a 7 section ARE 4.0 to a 6 section ARE 5.0.

Construction Site Mapping Programs,Dave Davis,1,4/4/2014 4:11 PM,"I had an intern ask if her experience with CA Site Mapping programs could count toward her CA Site Visit Experience.  
My first reaction was absolutely not but considering the sophistication of these programs and the ability to comment on specific questions on site, I would like to hear input from others.  
The program is called Multi-Vista and it allows us to count the number imbeds in concrete if we were so inclined.  Reviewing the images from the construction site, from multiple, upclose, detailed vantage points and making comments, while supplementing that task with actual site visits is giving our interns - who are not often able to visit our sites because of distance, exposure to real life, real time situations.  
Has anyone had to address a question like this?  Thoughts?"

Does new HS eligibility include foreign HS degrees?,Michael Ayles,1,2/7/2014 12:04 PM,"So now that the rules have changed and eligibility is granted upon receiving a HS diploma (or equivalent), I have this question: 
An international student, currently enrolled in their final year of a 5-year B. Arch program at Pune University in India, has asked if they are eligible to apply for the IDP.  I confirmed that their HS degree is also from India, not the U.S.
Ultimately, they plan on coming to the States after graduation to work and want to become licensed here in the U.S.  Assuming they start working for an architectural firm here in the U.S. (which would be acceptable), what happens when the HS diploma AND architectural degree are from India ... or another country?
What is interesting is that the IDP Guidelines previously indicated that IDP eligibility would be 1) enrollment in a NAAB/CACB-accredited degree program OR 2) employment in experience setting A after obtaining a U.S. HS diploma.
In today's guidelines, ""U.S."" has been removed from the diploma requirement.

============================
Dear Peter,
Thanks for your eagerness to help regarding licensing and IDP issues. 
Just to put this in writing, I am a Licensed Architect in Argentina with more than 15 years of building experience. I have been in the US for more than 13 years and had built projects in the US, Argentina and China. However, I have never worked in the US long enough to apply for IDP. 
I am now considering two routes. One of them is BEFA [Broadly Experienced Foreign Architect] and the other is the regular path to licensure. In the latter one, I found out that there is a ""Verification of Experience"" form which must be filled by a number of referees [Licensed Professionals] who would state my knowledge and qualifications to practice architecture. 
Both of these processes would lead to the ARE [Architecture Registration Examination] which I would have to take no matter what. The issue for me is getting to that point [ARE] in the most expedient and less bureaucratic manner.
Thanks in advance for your help and support in this and hopefully I should be able to move forward with this process soon.

Design-Build with Community Partners,Schaeffer Somers,1,7/14/2014 3:58 PM,"Hello, I need to articulate a policy for our students who participate in Summer and Academic Year Design-Build programs with community partners as part of the Univ. of Va. pre-professional and M.Arch curriculum.

__option 1: Design or Construction Related Employment (930 hours max);
__option 2: Leadership and Service (320 hours max); 
__option 3: Additional Opportunities/work with approved Community-Based Design Center/Collaborative (40 hours max);
__option 4: Site Visit with Mentor (40 hours max).

Design or Project Management??,Jason Newman,1,8/5/2014 11:58 AM,"Hello All-
A fellow intern has approach me with the following question and I want to get some confirmation that my response is accurate before I answer.  The question is essentially: Is it acceptable to report hours in a pre-design or design IDP category (Programming thru Material Selection & Specifications) for a project that is in CA? 
To be more specific, the intern is working CA for a project and she has spent some time coordinating S & MEP systems in the field.  Is it acceptable to apply these hours to the Engineering Systems which is a design category?  This activity can align with many of the “tasks & knowledge of/skill in” bullet points listed for both Construction Admin and Engineering Systems in the IDP guidelines. 
Which is correct?  Are both acceptable?  How much weight does project phase carry when it comes to reporting hours?

A student finished his second Masters last May (first prof. degree was an MArch) and just learned that he could claim it for 930 IDP hours. However, we were both shocked to find out that it falls under the timely reporting limits and is now only worth half the hours (465) because its been passed 6 months.  Considering that we're talking about an actual degree thats something certified and set in stone - that one can't just forget like a testimony of work hours - what is the justification for this? Surely this credit should fall under separate consideration. Is there any way that it can be reviewed and approved separately from the other elective hours and an exception be made?
That's a lot of time to be missing out on for a rule that's hardly justifiable in this case, or at questionable at best.  //L."

"Legal name change, but forgot to change NCARB record before trying to test",Chris Lewis,6,9/10/2014 1:49 PM,"I've got a person who has had a bad experience with NCARB and Prometrics regarding a name change due to marriage. She is facing a rolling clock deadline so recently signed up to take an exam, but she forgot that she had not updated her name due to marriage in her NCARB account, or the Pormetric site (she had tested 4 years ago, and realized she was coming up on losing a test if she didn't pass all by December). What is the official policy regarding name changes and when and how it needs to be done? I couldn't find anything on the site to help with this process. 
She contacted NCARB to have her name officially changed once she realized that it was incorrect, and went to the testing site with her previous and current ID, Passport, social security card, and Marriage certificate hoping that she would not be denied access to testing. She was, and had to pay full freight for the test.
So she is out the Cost of the exam, with an explanation from an NCARB customer service rep that she would have had to cancel the testing appointment and reschedule under her married name. But there is no cancelling a testing appointment, so she would be out the full cost of the test regardless of what she has done. This does not seem to be a fair situation for those that make an honest mistake when registering for their exams.
How are we informing a population of testers what the policy is, and how best to navigate it. This seems to disproportionately effect the female population of the profession as they are the most likely to change their names after marriage.
Is there anything we can due to help this person out? Is there another level she can take her claim to? Or is this just an expensive life lesson? She really just wants to test, and not have to pay the additional $210 for an exam she wasn't allowed to sit for."

Summary of IDP Changes,Mandi Tauferner,0,11/12/2014 12:59 PM,"Hello all, 
With all of the continuous changes to the IDP does anyone know of a document / list summarizing all of the changes to date to help keep track of it all?  
Specifically why I would like one is to help interns sort out: advice they hear from older IDP versions, from proposed changes versus actual-implemented changes, and to attempt to list them all in one location to help prevent things from going unnoticed/slipped through the cracks. It is hard today for an intern to get advice from peers even 1-2 years removed from where they are in the process because so many things have changed in that time frame alone.
Of course this 'list' this would need a disclaimer or two about its completeness/accuracy, but a baseline / starting point could be invaluable!
A timeline of these changes, possibly as an appendix to the IDP Guidelines, would be great to see - as acknowledgement of previous versions yet clarity on what is current and relevant. Clarifications and further questions could then, of course, be directed to a Licensing Advisor or NCARB directly.
Thanks!"

Senior person that wants to become licensed,Stephanie Osorio,4,11/25/2014 3:26 PM,"First off, I want to say that I am new to the forum and very excited to engage in the conversations that are happening here! Thank you to all the participants! OK, so I've been approached by someone about IDP/AREs and I was hoping someone could confirm my thoughts on the matter. This person has over 20 years of experience in a traditional architecture firm, but they have not become licensed or participated in the IDP program. I am planning on advising them to establish an NCARB record, however, I'd like to give them a sense of how long completing IDP might take for them and how their experience might differ from someone who just graduated college.  First the timing: I believe that they would be able to report the last 6 months AND 50% of the hours from the last five years. If you add on the last six months, it would seem to me that getting to the 5600 requirement would take less than a year. Now, in terms of what the day to day work might look like and how that might differ from someone on the junior staff: I wanted to confirm that this does not mean that they have to set down their management responsibilities and do the same things that a newly graduated student would do. For one thing, their billing rate is too high and it would kill the project budget! Here is a scenario: they are a manager during the construction document phase. They are NOT working in CAD to create the CDs, however, they are overseeing junior staff to do so. They can't count the many hours they completed over 20 years ago as a junior staff member, but I would think they can count the hours they are spending to manage/supervise the junior staff. In other words, I can't imagine that the intent of IDP would be to take a senior manager and have them switch to production/junior level work. I think this is a very important topic to discuss since the perception that IDP hours are made of  'junior' level work discourages people that have been working in architecture firms for years to become licensed. In my opinion, these are the most important people to be licensed since people look up to them in the firm. If they establish their NCARB record, and take the AREs, they will inspire the junior staff to do so.  If they see it as a giant hassle where they will have to find a way to fit doing CD production work at their billing rate into an impossible budget they won’t do it. Any thoughts would be very much appreciated!"

IDP Reactivation Fee Question - Susanne | TN,Susanne Tarovella,2,12/19/2014 4:45 PM,"Hello All,
I have an intern in TN who created her IDP record in 2008. Then she almost immediately got laid off, and she never logged any IDP hours. Fast forward 6 years. She's been to grad school and now has a job in a work setting ""A"" office. She recently logged into MyNCARB to restart the IDP process and found this message. 
""Fee: $1,375.00 (The current renewal is $225.00, plus a reactivation fee of $250.00, and previous unpaid costs of $900.00. Fee Schedule)""
This message is not consistent with the information on the ""How Much Does IDP Cost?"" page on the NCARB website.
Can someone please explain where $900 in ""unpaid costs"" comes from? Based on the NCARB web page that I'm referencing, it appears that this person would need to pay $300 to reactivate (no more than $425). 
Any clarification that you can provide would be very helpful. I don't want to discourage her from continuing with IDP.
Thanks, Susanne"

elective hours / LEED,Michael Glenboski,1,1/16/2015 12:08 PM,"Question from an intern who is assisting a contractor through the LEED process and looking where he could file those hours:
'Our role is to research the LEED credits they are pursuing, give them guidance on the credits and / or help them complete the documentation to submit to LEED online.  It’s a lot of LEED research and some production work / documentation for their submission.  
When I look through the IDP guidelines, there are “elective hours” that can be counted using LEED research but it looks more like studying for the LEED AP test.  It’s possible that this work doesn’t fall into any categories for IDP recording'

IDP Eligibility Date,Mandi Tauferner,2,7/10/2015 1:24 PM,"I have a question about retroactive eligibility for IDP.  
In Dec 2013 the requirements changed to simply a high school diploma (or GED), and we now get questions from interns who are looking to receive credit utilizing the 5 year 50% credit for hours worked.  Can this be logged retroactively all the way back to 2010?  Does the date of establishing their NCARB record matter?  What about their IDP eligibility date (if there is a formal one put on record)?
In addition to those general questions, we have one specific intern question that involves an intern who began reporting hours in 2008 or 2009, although he was not at that time eligible for IDP because he did not have a NAAB degree. I am unsure how his reporting was done, but he claims to have reported hours to NCARB and was never given credit.  Now the question is with the change in eligibility requirement that time logged would now be eligible, yet he is not able to retroactively get those hours approved on his record (yet they are documented).  Any thoughts?"
Supplemental Experience Approval,Mandi Tauferner,5,7/10/2015 1:33 PM,"For the supplemental experience opportunities where NCARB is listed as ""who approves"", when does this approval typically happen?  Shortly after each submittal or in one mass review at the completion of IDP?
We have interns asking because apparently some hours are getting approved and some are not.  My feeling is that those that are not getting approved have not been properly submitted/documented, but it would be nice to know if this is the case so they can be aware and correct it.  
Lastly, if a correction in documentation is needed (eg a self-reported CEU certificate was uploaded instead of their AIA transcript), can the clarification be made without affecting the 6 month rule?

Since NCARB has killed off the use of the term ""intern"" in their dealings what are your firms calling those that are currently on the path to license?

Are your firms retaining the trems Intern 1,2,3 to describe those that are in the IDP, and transition to Unlicensed Architecture/ design Staff for those that have not completed their ARE's but have more than 5600 hours experience? I know this all has to be tempered with the state license board regulations, but I was hoping to have some input on what others are doing in their practices to recommend to our office how best to proceed. Any thoughts?"
IDP with Construction,Kelsey Kauffman,0,8/26/2015 11:03 AM,"Hello! I have a student here that has worked in a construction management design build firm for the past few years and the firm that she is in does not have any architects in it, but the construction management firm works with an architecture firm very closely and she works closely with licensed architects. She would like to know if she can have them sign off on IDP hours? Is she able to do this since she is not paid by the architect firm? She is paid by the construction firm."
Getting Licensed in Massachusetts,Kathryn Wetherbee,2,8/27/2015 8:16 AM,"Hi All!  
So although I am the licensing advisor for Maine, I am actually getting licensed through MA.  I have a question on behalf of myself.  The NCARB website states that MA requires IDP with 5600 hours (the old way) this also is reflected on my NCARB record.  But when you go to the Massachusetts licensing website and I spoke with the office there, they just require IDP, ""whatever NCARB requires, no more, no less"" is what I was told.  
I was wondering is anybody here knew the full story because what NCARB has and what the State is saying seem to be different.
Thank you!
Katie"
"""Start your NCARB record"" presentation",Tyler Baldwin,0,8/31/2015 2:22 AM,"Hello all, 
I am new to the forum and the position of Student Licensing Advisor for IIT AIAS. Excited to help students as they transition to professionals through IDP and Licensure.
We plan to host a workshop on ""starting your record"".
Is there an updated presentation that we may use to help clearly get through the workshop and help start as many records and answer as many questions as possible? 
I noticed there is a general ""experience"" presentation uploaded but it is from 2013 and does not show the exact steps to starting a record. 
Thanks everyone!

BEA - Experience before or after licensure?,Linaea Floden,3,9/3/2015 3:03 PM,"Hey Guys - I need a quick turn around on this if you can help me sort out the criteria here ::
In reading the BEA requirements its states there is a  time requirement, candidates must ""Have comprehensive experience as a registered architect over a prescribed number of years: Six years for architects who hold a pre-professional degree
in architecture awarded by the U.S. regionally accredited
institution or the Canadian equivalent."" My candidate has practiced architecture [unlicensed] for over 20 years and wants to pursue licensure now in a state that doesn't require a NAAB degree (he has a only a 4 year architecture degree) and then pursue ""reciprocity"" in FL w/ the NCARB certificate. Are the BEA requirements stating that they have to have 6 years of LICENSED experience before they can apply for the NCARB certificate?
Thank you! //L."
IDP Record Review - How long does that take?,Linaea Floden,1,9/3/2015 7:51 AM,"Hi Again - I have a candidate who has recently passed their exams and is waiting for NCARB to ""formally review their IDP record for completion"" before providing it to the state. Please, what is the usual timeline for that process? He's in an urgent situation to stamp some drawings following a recent resignation at his firm... //L."
Supervisor Training,Hal Havens,2,2/8/2016 3:08 PM,My firm would like to provide a good training session for Supervisors and Mentors on IDP requirements and recent changes.  Can someone direct me to good video and PowerPoint presentations that would be good for this audience?  Maybe it is the same as the presentations for students.
International Masters Licence Question,Krisandrah Crall,1,9/21/2015 4:24 PM,"I have a few students wanting to go get their masters in another country, Norway, France, and some others. How would this affect their ability to complete the NCARB requirements to get their Architecture Licence in the US? What would their additional steps be? What should they look for in the international schools credentials to ease the process? and any other information about this topic would be great. 
Thanks"
How to get initial license after 25 years experience,Carrie Parker,7,10/22/2015 10:49 AM,"I have a colleague who has been working under licensed architects for 25 years. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Architecture from Spring Garden College near Philadelphia, a now defunct college. Through what path, and through what jurisdiction, can I advise him to get his initial license? I know NY and WI allow licenses without NAAB degrees. Though there is no college now to send a transcript.
Please help!"
Wisconsin Loop Hole for early sitting for the exam in now open,Russell LaFrombois,0,10/20/2015 10:09 AM,"for those of you who care, the Wisconsin loop hole allowing candidates to sit for the ARE early finally has the administration rules hashed out which eliminates all EDUCATIONAL and EXPERIENCE requirements for sitting for the exam.  That means that anyone who has a high school diploma can sit for the exams.  From the contacts that I have made, I cannot find a state that will not accept the testing results."
EPC after the overhaul,Russell LaFrombois,2,11/4/2015 5:12 PM,I want to make sure I am reading this correctly that the EPC work will no longer count towards IDP after the overhaul.  is that correct
IDP Overhaul,Andrew Malanowski,0,11/11/2015 10:16 AM,"I was advising on of our staff on the transition to IDP and helping them see where they fall after the transition.  They brought up a valid question.  
Will there be any additional requirements within the 6 new experience areas? Or for example could someone fulfill all their required hours under the ""Construction & Evaluation"" Category by doing shop drawings and paperwork and theoretically never set foot on a construction site?
I realize there will be more information coming out and new guidelines and things, but I thought it was a valid question worth asking."
Contractor settings,Robert Silance,3,11/12/2015 4:04 PM,"I assume that interns working for a contractor would submit their hours with the ""O"" training setting. Is this correct? My intern is having difficulty with this setting in that it will not allow the contractor to submit his licensure credentials in that setting."
Study Materials ARE,Sarah Bianchi,1,11/13/2015 10:19 AM,Are there any recommendations for study materials for the ARE that are typically given out for employees to use or that are recommended to employees to use to study with?
Taking the Exam in Wisconsin-rules now in place,Russell LaFrombois,0,12/23/2015 10:23 AM,I just received the notice that the rules for taking the exam in Wisconsin are in place and there are no educational or experience requirements (except a high school diploma) to sit for the exam.
Supplemental Experience Site Visit with Mentor - Academic Setting,Eric Hill,1,1/25/2016 10:48 AM,"Please confirm that graduate architecture students can earn supplemental credit for weekly, 1 hour site visits, with a registered architect mentor when the activity is for no academic credit - and up to a limit 40 hours. Am I also to understand that each student will need to submit a separate weekly report for each visit?"
Internship Paid by a Stipend,Michael Hricak,0,1/26/2016 7:55 PM,"The rule of thumb, for some time, has been a ""paid"" position (internships included) means you were being paid according to the labor laws in place in your location, which in turn usually means earning at least ""minimum wage"".
So does this mean a stipend, based on a 40 hour week and a 4 week month, which does not compute to the minimum hourly wage X 160 or so hours, is not considered a ""paid"" internship and therefore the intern is not eligible for IDP Credit?
Does ""paid"" mean fairly paid? or simply paid ""something""?"
"AIA HSW Credits, Post Overhaul",Linaea Floden,0,2/1/2016 11:49 AM,"Hey All - 
Since AIA HSW CEU's will still count towards AXP hours (Under ""O"") post the overhaul in June - What will happen to existing Elective Hours that were earned through AIA HSW CEU's- will someone be differentiating which were LUs and which were HSW and allowing those to be retained? Will people have the option of allocating what experience category these existing AIA hours will be allocated in the the new AXP format? Thanks! // Linaea"
